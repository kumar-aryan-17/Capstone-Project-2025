## Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

This repository contains the complete solution to the Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone Project hosted by IIT Guwahati and the Consulting & Analytics Club. The goal is to develop a real-time, intelligent pricing system for 14 urban parking spaces based on occupancy, queue length, traffic congestion, vehicle type, and nearby competition.

## ðŸ”„ Project Workflow

1. **Data Ingestion**: Dataset streamed into memory using Pathway preserving timestamps.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis** For obtaining hidden details about the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Occupancy rate, queue normalization, vehicle weight encoding.
4. **Model 1**: Increases price linearly based on current occupancy.
5. **Model 2**: Calculates a demand score using five features. Price scaled with smooth bounds.
6. **Model 3**: Adds geo-intelligence. Checks proximity and adjusts pricing competitively.
7. **Real-Time Output**: Streamed results pushed to JSON/log.
8. **Visualization**: Bokeh used to plot pricing across models.
